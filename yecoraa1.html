        <h3>Bio</h3> 
        <p>I was born in Miami, FL and moved to NYC at a very young age.<br>
        I went to a Catholic elementary school, graduated high school with<br>
        Pre-Med honors and student government experience, and began college<br>
        with a major in psychology at Hunter College. After attending Hunter<br>
        for a year, I realized that a career in psychology was not what I<br>
        truely wanted. I took time off from school to work and decide what<br>
        path I should be taking.</p>
        <p>Watching a commercial for the Art Insitute, I realized that graphic<br>
        design is what I want to do. I returned to QCC to finish my academic<br>
        career. Now, I am currently enrolled at QC in persuit of a bachelor's<br>
        degree in graphic design. I wish to persue my life-long dream of working<br>
        at Disney as an animator or graphic artist. However, I am also open to<br>
        other opprotunities or adventures in graphic design.</p>
